# Cameron's Personal Dashbaord

I got the idea to do this from [Sam Soffes](http://fat.soff.es) and [Christopher Hopkins](http://api.chocol.it/).

All the data is being pulled from my own Fitbit.

## Roadmap

- About page
- Blog post regarding the building of the dashbaord
- Fitbit Aria (scale) data
- I'd like to chart more on my diet, but Fitbit doesn't have that info and MyFitnessPal (what I'm using for food tracking) doesn't havea public API

## Developer Stuff

- I've never tried HAML before in a Ruby project so I thought this would be a good time to try.
- Icon fonts from [IcoMoon](icomoon.io)
- Charts with [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org)
- Fonts from TypeKit
	- AW Conqueror
	- CamingoDos
